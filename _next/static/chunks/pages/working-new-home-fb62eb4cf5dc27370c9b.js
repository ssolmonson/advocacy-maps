Public funding provisions exist in the Commonwealth \n    for candidates for statewide office, but candidates for state legislature seats have \n    no such support. The data on publicly financed elections is clear. When Connecticut \n    implemented publicly financed elections, legislators were able to spend less time \n    fundraising and spend more time with constituents.
