            <b>What is the Good Governance Project [GGP]?</b>
            <br/>
            <br/>
            We are a non-partisan, student-driven initiative at Boston College Law School
            and the BC Clough Center for Constitutional Democracy. We advocate for faith in democracy,
            and for democratic structures worth of faith; inclusive, equitable and responsive.
            Using our Democracy Maps, we aggregate voices from across the state to advance
            discussion on key governance issues. We also provide legal support to pro-democracy
            organizations and legislators, and host events to galvanize and encourage faith in democracy.
            <br />

            <b>The GGP Priorities</b>
            <br />
            <br />
            After studying our political institutions in the fall and winter, the GGP students identified
            three state legislative priorities to improve the quality of democracy in Massachusetts:
            <a href="/election-day-registration"> election day registration;</a><a href="/early-mail-voting"> early voting & vote-by-mail; </a>
            and <a href="/campaign-finance"> publicly financed campaigns</a>.
            While there are many other legislative improvements to make to our democracy, which we identify <a href="/other-legislative-endorsements">here</a>,
            these three priorities reflect the impactful, pragmatic, and common ground changes the GGP hopes to advance.
