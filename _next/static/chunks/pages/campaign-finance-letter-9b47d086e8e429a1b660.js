In 1998, the voters of Massachusetts overwhelmingly approved a ballot measure to allow candidates who agreed to spending and donation limits access to public funds. But in 2003, the legislature repealed the fair elections law as a last-minute amendment to the state budget. Public funding provisions exist in the Commonwealth for candidates for statewide office, but candidates for state legislature seats have no such support.  SD.122 would give candidates for state legislature who meet donor and fundraising benchmarks access to public funds for campaigning, which would allow a broader range of people to run for office. Fair election funded candidates under the bill would agree to participate in a public debate before the primary and at least 2 public debates after the primary, which would allow the voters of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts to make an informed choice about whom they choose to vote for."}),Object(i.jsx)("p",{Style:"text-indent:1cm",children:"The data on publicly financed elections is clear. When Connecticut implemented publicly financed elections, legislators were able to spend less time fundraising and spend more time with constituents. More citizens became donors and educated themselves about policy issues. The influence of lobbyists declined, more bipartisan bills were passed, and bills passed were more closely aligned with public opinion. Public financing also allowed more people to run for office, and more diverse legislators were elected. In Arizona, when public financing was passed in 2000, the state saw a 20% increase in the number of voters between the 1996 and 2004 presidential elections. The people of Massachusetts deserve responsive representation in the state legislature, and adopting public financing would help achieve that goal."}),Object(i.jsx)("p",{Style:"text-indent:1cm",children:"Passing SD.122 would be a statement by the Massachusetts state legislature that it represents the people of the commonwealth, not special interests.
