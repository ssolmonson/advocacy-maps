Currently, twenty-two states allow Election Day registration in some form. In those states, voter turnout has increased considerably upon enactment. This, in conjunction with the permanent codification of pandemic protocols, will ensure increased access to voters who might have otherwise not been able to participate in this democratic process, owing to work conflicts, health concerns, and other barriers. Relatedly, requiring registration before Election Day discourages so-called \u201clower propensity\u201d voters who might miss the opportunity to vote just because they are not aware of the registration deadline. This requirement has the effect of disenfranchising those who engage with the election cycle closer to Election Day, when interest in politics is at its highest. Enacting Election Day registration allows more people the opportunity to vote, no matter when they engage with the political process."}),Object(i.jsx)("p",{Style:"text-indent:1cm",children:"Those who oppose the adoption of same-day voter registration argue that by allowing registration to occur at any time up through and including election day, there would be insurmountable financial and administrative costs, as well as increased voter fraud.

On the subject of administrative costs, the same study also found that implementation of same day voter registration, particularly on election day, drastically reduces the need for provisional ballots and saves the time and expense of processing ballots."}),Object(i.jsx)("p",{Style:"text-indent:1cm",children:"Finally, regarding the issue of fraud--our most recent electoral cycle showed us that while concerns about fraudulent voting are high, the incidences of fraud are quite low.
