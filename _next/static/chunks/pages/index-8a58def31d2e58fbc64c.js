Public funding provisions exist in the Commonwealth \n    for candidates for statewide office, but candidates for state legislature seats have \n    no such support. The data on publicly financed elections is clear. When Connecticut \n    implemented publicly financed elections, legislators were able to spend less time \n    fundraising and spend more time with constituents. More citizens became donors and \n    educated themselves about policy issues. The influence of lobbyists declined, and \n    more bipartisan, publicly supported bills were passed.
